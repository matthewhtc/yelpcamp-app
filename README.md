# YelpCamp App

## Description
Welcome to my my YelpCamp app! This app was created through Colt Steele's web development bootcamp. To give it its own flavour, I gave the app a Vancouver theme: people can give ratings to the best spots in the city.

## Technologies
Technologies used in this app include: 
* Node.js
* MongoDB 
* Express.js
* Passport.js

Furthermore, the application has been deployed on Heroku. Find it [here](https://still-savannah-66696.herokuapp.com/)!
